# micrograd
A small-scale Autograd engine that implements backpropagation and visualizes the Neural Network as a DAG. This engine can be implemented as an API with the goal to understand the framework behind Deep Learning libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow. This is a direct implementation of the course by Andrej Karpathy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0)
